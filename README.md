# python-src-template

A template I use for most projects and is setup to jive with my environment at
the company I work with.

This is not the one-shot solution to project structure or packaging. This is
just what works well for one egg on the Internet. Feel free to use it as you see
fit.

## FAQ

- **Q:** Should I follow everything to the absolute letter in this template?
  - **A:** Heck no, I don't even do that! This is just the closest
    one-size-fits-most template I've put together. Use what you want how you
    want.

- **Q:** Why do you hard pin your development and test requirements?
  - **A:** For control over the environment used to develop on the package. It
    is also beneficial in many of the areas I work where artifactory proxies are
    between `pip` and the pypi public index. Versions remaining hard pinned
    ensure the package is always cleared for use through the artifactory.

- **Q:** Why not put the requirements into the `pyproject.toml`?
  - **A:** Mostly because `pip-compile` does all the work for me and doesn't
    target the `pyproject.toml`. Partly because many of my projects need to be
    scanned by utilities that still think `requirements.txt` is the only pattern
    to use.

- **Q:** Why does this template change so often?
  - **A:** I'm constantly finding new tweaks that make the template fit just a
    little better. I'm also open to ideas and suggestions so please drop an
    issue if you have one.
